Exists to that Felix at boot can check if there is an update available.
Changing the number to somehting higher than a variable in Felix sc, would indicate that a new update is available.
When Felix finds that there is an update, he will prompt the user to upgrade. 
But as before it's up to the user to decide if he/she wants to update.
